**We're so glad you've decided to ride with us! Every dollar you raise supports patient care and research at Smilow Cancer Hospital and Yale Cancer Center.**

## How it Works

Each rider must commit to raising at least $500 and, as part of Team Craft Beer, you'll have access to a number of veteran riders who can help guide your fundraising efforts. There *may* even be team fundraisers which may help supplement those who are struggling to reach the $500 threshold. 

## Get Started

Go to the [Team Craft Beer Page][1] on the *Closer to Free Ride* website and click the green **Join Our Team** button. Then complete the rest of the registration process as normal. 

## Training Rides

Once you've registered, be sure to [Like Us on Facebook][2] (NOTE: We need to make a FB page) or [Follow Us on Twitter][3]. We will post about events and training rides there. There are usually a beginner level and intermediate level route for each ride so even new riders can find join in. 

We have all levels of riders. Whether you choose 10 miles, 25 miles, 40 miles, 65 miles or 100 miles, we'll have team members riding with you. 

## Keep In Touch

Feel free to reach out on your preferred Social Media channel or [drop us a line][4] to let us know a bit more about you. Or just join us for one of our Training Rides and a Beer!
