It's amazing to see so many folks along the path the day of the ride. If you are willing and able to camp out along the ride path & cheer us on, it really truly helps. 

You can see the various route maps here: [Closer to Free Ride Maps](https://www.rideclosertofree.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1091). We hope to plan a few cheering stations along the way. Stay tuned for details.
