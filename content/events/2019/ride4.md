### Saturday, June 8th, 2019 

*** UPDATE: Please note the ride departure point has changed to the MILFORD address below. *** 

- 32.9 Mile Route
- Depart at 9:00 AM from [35 Wilbar Ave, Milford CT][start].

Training ride #4 is a 36 mile loop starting at Marty's House (Marty is Captain of Team Craft Beer). 

TCB member, David Brown, will be shooting video of the ride and conducting a few interviews where riders will have an opportunity to share their stories and talk a bit about why they ride. The video is just another tool to spread the Closer to Free message and amplify our collective fundraising impact to beat cancer!

Oh and beers, burgers & dogs following the ride! (Courtesy of the Captain!)

Here's the [32.9 mile route map (via STRAVA)][strava].
