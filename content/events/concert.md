Closer to Free's Official Band FREEPLAY comes to NEBCO again on a "Final Friday" for TEAM CRAFT BEER!!!  Come help raise money and/or register to ride for the Closer to Free benefit taking place September 7, 2019.  Team Craft Beer is one of the TOP TEAMS of the event, and has raised over $100,000 last year alone.  They are looking to top all records next year, all to benefit the Smilow Cancer Center at Yale New Haven Hospital.  FREEPLAY has been the Official Band for the Closer to Free ride since it started over 9 years ago, and will be bringing the energy!  There will be a great food truck, Me Stezo Grill on site along with the SUPERIOR BEERS at NEW ENGLAND BREWING COMPANY!!!
