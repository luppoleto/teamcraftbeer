### Sunday, May 19th, 2019 

- 30 Mile Route, Depart at 9:00 AM
- 50 Mile Route, Depart at 8:00 AM

Training ride #3 generally sticks to the Rail Trail. Although, those 50-milers may extend their trip via another route. 

Here's the [30 mile route map (via STRAVA)][1]. 

Whether you're riding 15,30, or 50. The goal is to be back at [MiKro Depot][2] at 11:30-Noon for a beer....or 2. For those not familiar with MiKro, the Rail Trail runs directly behind [their location][3]. Anyone looking to do less than 30 you CAN! just start at a later time on the same path and shorten it to your own distance. Just plan to rendezvous at Mikro 11:30-Noon.

[RSVP on our Facebook Page][4] So we can get a head count and be sure not to leave without you!
We look forward to seeing y'all this weekend in the SUNSHINE!!!

A jersey fit kit will be available for anyone who wants confirm the sizing of their Team Craft Beer jersey or the Closer to Free Jersey (they are coming from the same vendor).
