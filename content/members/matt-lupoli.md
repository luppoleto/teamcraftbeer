## Matt's Bike is Equipped with Saddle Bags...FOR BEER!

On any given weekend, Matt may be seen biking the trails & roads throughout Connecticut & Massachussets in search of delicious craft beer. Yes, those saddle bags are insulated. And YES! They are for beer! As a beer lover, cyclist and brave cancer survivor, Team Craft Beer seemed like a perfect fit for Matt -- we're honored to ride alongside him! 

**Matt & [Team Captain, Marty][marty] recently spoke to local NBC station (WFSB) about their personal connections with cancer. [Watch Now!][watch]**
