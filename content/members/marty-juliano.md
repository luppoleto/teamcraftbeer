## A Message from Our Captain...

On September 7th, 2019 I will be volunteering for the 9th annual Closer to Free Ride for Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. The company I work for New England Brewing will be a sponsor of the event this year. We have also formed a kisk ass team "Team Craft Beer" to ride and fundraise for the event again as well. For more info on [how to join the Team click here][join]. 

This will be my 9th year volunteering, riding and sponsoring the event. I do this in memory of my mother *Anne Juliano Gonsalves*, my uncle *Frank Juliano*, my brother-in-law *Charles Valendra* and many other family members who have all passed away after being diagnosed with cancer. 

This year, a close friends brother has been fighting the battle and it is sad to see how much the disease affects the whole family not just the patient. I am proud of her and how she continues to give of herself to help out anywhere she is needed to. Family is everything!   

Our team, **Team Craft Beer New England** was created in their memory and in memory of all who fight the battle with cancer every day. Last year we raised $120,000 thanks to friends family and strangers. This year we have committed to raising $150,000 and I hope you'll help us reach (or even exceed) that goal. Any size donation is appreciated. 100 percent of the dollars I raise for the *Closer to Free Ride* will directly support patient care and research at Smilow Cancer Hospital and Yale Cancer Center. Smilow is Southern New England's premier cancer hospital and the ride is its signature fundraising event.

Cancer touches so many people in our community and the Closer to Free Ride is a great way to help fight this terrible disease. Please seriously consider this request and let your friends, neighbors, and community know that you are joining in the cause. 

Together We Can Make a Difference and make everyone CLOSER TO FREE!

**- Marty**
