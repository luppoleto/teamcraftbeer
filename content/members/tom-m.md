## It's Always Stout Season

For Tom, the only time it's not stout season is when it's porter season -- which is usually just a break between stouts. Tom found many other folks in the Connecticut Beer scene who share his love of stouts and decided to start selling "It's Always Stout Season" t-shirts at $20 a pop. All the proceeds go towards his Closer to Free ride. 

You can buy his shirts online at the [Full Pours Radio Store](http://fullpoursradio.com/store/?fbclid=IwAR3y3rILBrHDILNOpEazfSUv7CoBtehrzmy__nqfBSjRscXM0b2RNbVF5I8)
