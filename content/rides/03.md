6/6/2021 - Ride will depart from Brewport 225 South Frontage Rd Bridgeport at 9:30AM and will go to Silver Sands Beach park Beach in Milford and back thru Seaside Park. Approximately 30 miles. We would like to see if we can get a few people to fill some roles on the ride. Lead Person, mid group support and a sweep person Please let me know if you are willing to assume one of the roles. For some we did this ride in 2019. Jeff Browning from Brewport will be providing each rider a nice cold beer upon your return. Please email me or post here if you are coming so we can get a head count. Thanks.
